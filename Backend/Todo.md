0. Location distribution isn't working properly and messages aren't being distrbuted to nearby people
1. Need to fix the JWT token transmission so that it doesn't transmit with a GET request and in the url path of the GET request
2. Need to create the location aspect of the messages and to distribute messages based on location
3. New client socket connections are created without their location
4. Location message distributing method is bruteforce right now and needs to be made to be better
